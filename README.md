# Final-Project-C220
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2025

## Theme: You Only Get One
We decided to make the player have "one" life. One and done!

## Game Play

Use A and D to move left and right. Use space to jump and navigate obstacles.

## Impediments
Our biggest struggles came with syncing our progress with one another. We lost a lot of work trying to get on the same syncs.

## Implementation
